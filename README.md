LJC: Real-time Stream Processing in Spring Made Easy


Join Fawaz Ghali, Developer Advocate at Hazelcast as he discusses Real-time Stream Processing in Spring Made Easy

About this event
Real-time stream processing is growing exponentially in recent years, businesses need to gather insights from real-time data as soon as itâ€™s generated. To do this, developers and software architects use various pipelines and tools to capture and process data in motion. Real-time stream processing has its own challenges such as windowing, event time and late events, streaming fault tolerance, and processing guarantees. On the other hand, Spring is all about simplicity, and the question becomes how can you develop a real-time stream processing in Spring?

In this talk, you will learn how to overcome these challenges and best practices for real-time stream processing using the Hazelcast open-source platform. The talk will include a demo to show how you can optimize your real-time streaming projects in Spring in the following areas: scalability, performance, failover, reliability, and data recovery, the code will be available on Github.
